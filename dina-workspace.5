.TH DINA-WORKSPACE 5 DINA\-VERSION
.SH NAME
dina-workspace \- DINA workspace layout configuration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ~/.config/dina/workspace_layout
.SH DESCRIPTION
The workspace_layout file stores DINA's persistent workspace assignments for applications.
This allows DINA to automatically place applications on their assigned workspaces when launched.
.P
When a user moves a window to a specific workspace using Super+Shift+[1-9], DINA remembers
this assignment and will automatically place that application on the same workspace in future
sessions. This creates a consistent and predictable environment, especially beneficial for
screen reader users who rely on spatial memory.
.SH FORMAT
The workspace_layout file uses a simple text format with one application entry per line.
.P
Each line consists of three fields separated by vertical bars (|):
.IP "1." 4
ApplicationClass - The X11 window class (WM_CLASS) of the application
.IP "2." 4
ApplicationInstance - The X11 window instance (also from WM_CLASS)
.IP "3." 4
WorkspaceNumber - The workspace number (1-9) where the application should be placed
.P
Lines beginning with # are treated as comments.
.P
Empty lines are ignored.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
# DINA Workspace Layout Configuration
# Format: application_class|application_instance|workspace_number
# This file is automatically generated by DINA when you move windows between workspaces
# The window class and instance are from the X11 WM_CLASS property

.SH BEHAVIOR
.TP
.B Automatic Application Placement
When an application starts, DINA checks if it has a workspace assignment in this file.
If found, DINA places the application on its assigned workspace automatically.
.TP
.B Audio Notification
When an application is automatically placed on a workspace other than the default (workspace 1),
DINA plays a sound and announces via speech synthesis which workspace the application was placed on.
.TP
.B Default Workspace Exception
Applications are only automatically placed on workspaces 2-9. Workspace 1 is considered
the default workspace and preferences for it are not saved.
.TP
.B Manual Override
A user can always manually move an application to a different workspace using Super+Shift+[1-9],
which will update the stored preference for future launches.
.TP
.B Clearing Preferences
Moving a tracked application to workspace 1 will remove it from the workspace layout file,
effectively "untracking" it. DINA will play a sound and announce that the application
is no longer being tracked. This provides a simple way to clear workspace preferences.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B ~/.config/dina/workspace_layout
The configuration file storing workspace assignments.
.SH NOTES
The workspace configuration file is automatically created when you first move an application
to a specific workspace.
.P
The directory ~/.config/dina/ will be created if it doesn't exist.
.P
You can edit this file manually if you prefer, but be careful to maintain the correct format.
