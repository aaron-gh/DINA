DINA - DINA Is Not Aesthetics
============================
DINA is a stripped-down, accessibility-first fork of dwm tailored for
blind users and screen reader workflows.

Philosophy
---------
DINA doesn't draw. DINA doesn't float. DINA doesn't get in your way.
It's for users who hear, not see.

DINA removes all visual overhead and focuses on speech-based, keyboard-only
navigation â€” ideal for Orca users and terminal-centric workflows.

Features
-------
- Always uses monocle layout (fullscreen windows)
- No status bar
- No layout switching
- No floating window support
- Audio + speech feedback via sox and spd-say
- YAD-based application launcher, accessible with Orca
- Screen blackout toggle script for full visual suppression
- Low battery warning via notify-send and spd-say
- Clean keyboard control via sxhkd
- Orca screen reader autostart for immediate accessibility
- Workspace memory that remembers which applications belong on which workspaces

Requirements
-----------
- libx11, libxinerama, libxft
- orca, yad, sxhkd, sox, acpi, speech-dispatcher
- dialog (for interactive setup)
- A terminal emulator

Installation
-----------
Option 1: Debian Package (recommended)

Download the latest release package from the GitHub Releases page and install:

    sudo dpkg -i dina_1.0-1_amd64.deb
    sudo apt-get install -f  # Installs dependencies

Option 2: From Source

Build and install as root:

    make clean install

Then setup user configs as your user:

    make userinstall

This will run the interactive setup to install scripts,
configure keybindings, and set up preferred applications.

Building Debian Packages:

    # Using Docker (cross-platform):
    bash packaging/build-with-docker.sh

    # On Debian systems:
    bash packaging/build-package.sh

Configuration
------------
The configuration of DINA is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.

Additional user configuration is managed through the interactive
setup process and the sxhkd configuration file.

Workspace Configuration
---------------------
DINA remembers which applications belong on which workspaces, creating
a consistent and predictable environment.

- Automatic Placement: When you launch an application that has previously 
  been assigned to a specific workspace, DINA automatically places it there 
  and announces this with audio feedback.

- Setting Preferences: To set a workspace preference for an application,
  move it to your desired workspace using Super+Shift+[1-9].
  DINA will remember this preference and apply it automatically next time.

- Configuration File: Your workspace layout is stored in:
  ~/.config/dina/workspace_layout

- Clearing Preferences: To remove an application from workspace tracking,
  move it to workspace 1 (Super+Shift+1). DINA will announce that the
  application is no longer being tracked.

Format: Each line in the file follows this pattern:
  ApplicationClass|ApplicationInstance|WorkspaceNumber

Example Configuration:
  # DINA Workspace Layout Configuration
  Firefox|Navigator|2
  Thunderbird|Mail|3
  Terminal|xterm|4

Applications will only be placed on workspaces 2-9 automatically.
Workspace 1 is considered the default and not remembered.
