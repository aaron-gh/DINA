Description: Accessibility-first window manager for blind users
 DINA (DINA Is Not Aesthetics) is an accessibility-first fork of dwm
 window manager tailored specifically for blind users and screen reader
 workflows.
 .
 Key features:
  * Always uses monocle layout (fullscreen windows)
  * No status bar or visual elements
  * Audio and speech feedback via sox and speech-dispatcher
  * Orca screen reader autostart for immediate accessibility
  * YAD-based accessible application launcher
  * Clean keyboard-only navigation
 .
 DINA removes all visual overhead and focuses on speech-based,
 keyboard-only navigation â€” ideal for Orca users and terminal-centric
 workflows.
