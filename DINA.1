.TH DINA 1 DINA\-VERSION
.SH NAME
DINA \- DINA Is Not Aesthetics window manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B DINA
.RB [ \-v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
DINA is an accessibility-first window manager for X, derived from dwm (dynamic window manager).
It's designed specifically for blind users and screen reader workflows, focusing on speech-based, keyboard-only navigation.
.P
DINA uses a completely headless approach that always displays windows in monocle layout (fullscreen),
making it ideal for screen reader users who prefer a single window at a time.
There are no visual UI elements like status bars, and no floating window functionality.
All visual elements have been removed to focus 100% on the accessible, speech-based experience.
.P
DINA features a fully modular code architecture with an integrated keybinding system
that supports multi-layered key combinations and runtime configuration. It does not
rely on external tools like sxhkd for keyboard shortcuts, and it automates Orca
screen reader startup.
.P
Windows are grouped by tags. Each window can be tagged with one or multiple
tags. Selecting certain tags displays all windows with these tags.
.P
DINA provides audio and speech feedback via 'sox' and 'spd-say' for critical
operations like window focus changes, tag switching, and screen blackout toggling.
.SH OPTIONS

.SH USAGE

.SH CUSTOMIZATION
DINA can be customized in two ways:

.TP
.B Runtime Configuration
DINA uses a human-readable configuration file located at ~/.config/dina/config.
This file allows you to customize keybindings, autostart applications, workspace
settings, and accessibility options without recompiling. See dina-config(5) for details.

.TP
.B Compilation Configuration
For advanced users, DINA can still be customized by creating a custom config.h and
(re)compiling the source code. This is less recommended for most users but maintains
compatibility with the traditional suckless approach.
.SH ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES
.TP
.B YAD-based application launcher
An accessible application menu that works well with screen readers.
.TP
.B Screen blackout toggle
A script to completely turn off the display for users who don't need visual output.
.TP
.B Audio feedback
