.TH DINA 1 DINA\-VERSION
.SH NAME
DINA \- DINA Is Not Aesthetics window manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B DINA
.RB [ \-v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
DINA is an accessibility-first window manager for X, derived from dwm (dynamic window manager).
It's designed specifically for blind users and screen reader workflows, focusing on speech-based, keyboard-only navigation.
.P
DINA uses a simplified approach that always displays windows in monocle layout (fullscreen),
making it ideal for screen reader users who prefer a single window at a time.
There is no status bar and no floating window functionality, removing visual overhead
to focus on an accessible, speech-based experience.
.P
Windows are grouped by tags. Each window can be tagged with one or multiple
tags. Selecting certain tags displays all windows with these tags.
.P
DINA provides audio and speech feedback via 'sox' and 'spd-say' for critical
operations like window focus changes, tag switching, and screen blackout toggling.
